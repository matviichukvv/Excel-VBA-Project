# Excel-VBA-Project

This project features a tool built in Excel VBA to calculate a rating for U.S. Congress members based on their voting records on Ukraine-related issues. The tool assigns scores based on the significance of each vote and generates an overall rating.    

The formulas and approach used in this tool are flexible and can be easily adapted for future analyses. The client can modify the weights or add new voting data to update the ratings as new votes occur, making it a sustainable solution for ongoing evaluations.  

This tool helps users quickly assess how strongly each member of Congress supports or opposes Ukraine-related policies.  

Key Features:  

Weighted Votes: Important votes are given more weight, ensuring that critical decisions impact the rating more heavily.  
Rating Calculation: The tool processes voting records, assigning a percentage score based on support for Ukraine.  

Support Categories: Based on their score, Congress members are categorized as:  
Strong Supporter (75% and above)  
Supporter (50% to 74.99%)  
Negative (below 50%)
